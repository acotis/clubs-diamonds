//! A brute-forcer for finding short mathematical expressions in Rust, for code golf.
//!
//! This crate provides the following types:
//!
//! - [`Expression`]: A struct representing a mathematical expression, such as `3*(a+5)` or `b>>a|89%c`. Uses an optimized representation internally, but adheres to Rust syntax, Rust operators, Rust precedence levels, and Rust semantics.
//! - [`Searcher`]: A configurable search type which can be used to systematically search all syntactically valid expressions in increasing order of length, and yield only those which meet a customizeable, user-specified criterion.
//!
//! And the following trait:
//!
//! - [`Number`]: A helper trait used by `Expression` and `Searcher`. Implemented for all of Rust's built-in integer data types (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize`). 
//!
//! # Basic example
//!
//! Suppose you want to find an expression `f` in a single variable `a` such that, when you plug in the values 1 through 5 for the variable, the expression yields the first five prime numbers. In other words, you want:
//!
//! - f(1) = 2
//! - f(2) = 3
//! - f(3) = 5
//! - f(4) = 7
//! - f(5) = 11
//!
//! You can ask Clubs to find you such an expression using the following complete program:
//!
//! ```
//! use clubs_diamonds::{Searcher, Expression};
//! 
//! fn main() {
//!     let (count, solutions) =
//!         Searcher::<i32, 1>::new(|expr: &Expression::<i32, 1>| {
//!             expr.apply(&[1]) == Some(2) &&
//!             expr.apply(&[2]) == Some(3) &&
//!             expr.apply(&[3]) == Some(5) &&
//!             expr.apply(&[4]) == Some(7) &&
//!             expr.apply(&[5]) == Some(11)
//!         })
//!         .threads(4)
//!         .run_with_ui();
//! 
//!     println!("Searched {} expressions total", count);
//!     println!("The first three solutions we found were:");
//!     println!("    — {}", solutions[0]);
//!     println!("    — {}", solutions[1]);
//!     println!("    — {}", solutions[2]);
//! 
//!     // solutions is a Vec<Expression::<i32, 1>>
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Executing the above code brings up a text-based UI that looks like this:
//!
//! ![A screenshot of the text-based interface of the Clubs expression searcher. On the right, several information boxes tell us what expressions are currently being searched by each of four threads, how long the search has been running for, how many expressions are being searched per second, and other stats. On the left, six found solutions are listed.][demo]
//!
#![doc = embed_doc_image::embed_image!("demo", "assets/demo_medium.png")]
//!
//! The controls are:
//!
//! - `D`: show/hide description box
//! - `T`: show/hide thread list
//! - `S`: show/hide runtime stat box
//! - `I`: show/hide solution inspector
//! - `N`: show/hide news feed
//! - `+` / `-`: increase/decrease target thread count
//!   - Decreases in thread count may take a while to take effect because the thread count cannot decrease until one of the currently-running threads finishes its task, and the tasks can be minutes or hours long.
//! - `J` / `K`: navigate downward/upward in the list of solutions
//! - `Q`: quit (confirm/cancel with `Y` / `N`)
//! 
//! When you quit the UI, control flow returns to the main function, and the `println!` statements display the information returned by the `.search_with_ui()` method. The returned information is:
//!
//! - `count`: a u128 representing the total number of expressions which were considered during the search (including those which were rejected because they didn't meet the specified criterion).
//! - `solutions`: a Vec containing the expressions that did meet the criterion.
//! 
//! **Limitation note:** Clubs does not currently consider expressions containing the unary `-` operator (arithmetic negation). For unsigned types, this doesn't matter because the operator is inapplicable anyway. For signed types, this means Clubs will sometimes miss valid expressions that could have been solutions. Instead, it will find longer versions of these expressions that contain terms like `0-a` in place of `-a`. This is planned to be fixed in a later version of the crate.
//!
//! # Workflow for performing a search
//!
//! There is a four-step workflow for performing a search using the `Searcher` type. The steps are described in more detail in sections below. Here is the workflow:
//!
//! 1. **Decide the number and type of variables** which will appear in the expression.
//!     - Specify these choices as type parameters of the `Searcher`.
//! 2. **Construct** the searcher using the method `Searcher::new()`.
//!     - When you call this method, you supply a closure that accepts an `&Expression` and returns a `bool`. This is the "judge" that is used to determine which expressions are displayed in the Solutions panel in the UI (and eventually returned in the solutions Vec).
//! 3. Optionally, **specify additional parameters** for the search by using some of `Searcher`'s Builder-Lite methods.
//! 4. **Execute** the search using either the `.run_with_ui()` method or the `.run_silently()` method.
//!
//! ## Step 1a: Number of variables
//!
//! Clubs is capable of finding both single-variable and multi-variable expressions. The number of variables is a type parameter of the `Searcher` struct. If you set it to `1`, it will find single-variable expressions. If you set it to `2`, it will find two-variable expressions, etc. Variables are always named with single-letter names, starting with "a" for the first variable, "b" for the second, and so on.
//!
//! For example, a single-variable search will consider expressions like:
//! - `3+a`
//! - `a*a*47`
//! - `a%27<<(a&43-a)`
//! - ...and so on.
//!
//! A two-variable search will consider expressions like:
//! - `a+b`
//! - `a*b+73`
//! - `a>>(47%b+a|89)`
//! - ...and so on.
//!
//! In this version of the crate, a `Searcher` will only consider expressions which contain every variable at least once. For example, a two-variable `Searcher` will not consider the expression `b+9` because the variable `a` does not appear in it.
//!
//! ## Step 1b: Type of variables
//!
//! In Rust, every variable has an unchanging type, and Rust is generally a hard-ass about enforcing that types match. If `x` is a `u32` and `y` is an `i128`, then `x*y` is a syntactically invalid expression and will fail to compile with a type error.
//!
//! In Clubs, the `Searcher` requires that every variable in an expression has the same type, and this type must be specified as a type parameter of the `Searcher` itself. If you set it to `u8`, it will find expressions whose inputs (and output) are `u8`s. If you set it to `isize`, it will find expressions whose inputs (and output) are `isize`s.
//!
//! #### Extra details for type nerds
//!
//! For the most part, this requirement of Clubs is simply a requirement of Rust, as described above. If `x` is a `u32` and `x*y` is a valid expression, then `y` must be a `u32` as well, and `x*y` will evaluate to one too. This type-matching rule is true of the binary operators `*`, `/`, `%`, `+`, `-`, `&`, `^`, and `|`, and the of unary operators `!` and `-`.
//!
//! However, it is not true of the bitshift operators, `<<` and `>>`. These operators are special in that the left and right operands are NOT required to have the same type. `x>>y` is valid Rust code even if `x` and `y` are different types (in fact, any pair of integer numeric types works). The only constraint enforced for these operators is that the output type must be equal to the type of the left operand.
//!
//! Since this is the case, it is possible in principle to imagine a two-variable expression whose input variables have distinct types, and it is possible in principle to imagine a search for such expressions — for example, a search for expressions whose input variables are of type `i64` and `u16`. Such a search would consider expressions like `a>>b`, `(b+3^9)<<33*a`, and `b>>(a<<b)`, but not `a+b*21` or even `a|b`. And, it would provide an interface by which you could apply each candidate expression to pairs of input values of types `i64` and `u16`.
//!
//! **Clubs is not capable of performing this search.** It is a limitation of the current architecture. In Clubs, you may only perform searches for expressions whose input variables all have the same type and whose output type is the same one as that. The type you choose is a type parameter of the `Searcher` struct and of the `Expression` structs it yields.
//!
//! ## Step 2: Constructing a Searcher
//!
//! A Searcher is constructed using the method `Searcher::new()`, which accepts a closure as its only argument. The closure must accept an `&Expression` and return a `bool`. This is where you specify your customizeable criterion for expressions to be tested against.
//!
//! Generally speaking, you will judge an expression by calling the `.apply()` method provided by the `Expression` type and checking things about its return values. This method accepts an array of input variable values and returns the output value the expression evaluates to for those inputs. The return value is wrapped in an `Option`, and the value `None` is returned when the given inputs would cause the expression to crash with a runtime error (for example, if it ends up dividing by zero).
//!
//! Here is an example of a `Searcher` being constructed for a two-variable search using `i16` variables:
//!
//! ```
//! use clubs_diamonds::{Searcher, Expression};
//! 
//! fn main() {
//!     Searcher::<i16, 2>::new(|expr: &Expression::<i16, 2>| {
//!         expr.apply(&[1, 3]) == Some(5) &&
//!         expr.apply(&[5, -2]) == Some(-6) &&
//!         expr.apply(&[-8, 7]) == None
//!     })
//!     .run_with_ui();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This `Searcher` will consider all expressions containing two `i16` variables. For example:
//! - At some point, the `Searcher` will consider the expression `a+b`:
//!     1. To evaluate this expression, it will pass an `&Expression` representing it to the provided closure.
//!     2. The closure will call `expr.apply(&[1, 3])` and get `Some(4)` as the answer.
//!     3. Since that doesn't match the expected value, the boolean logic will short-circuit, the closure will return `false`, and the `Searcher` will reject the expression.
//! - At some point, the `Searcher` will consider the expression `a^b+1`.
//!     1. To evaluate this expression, it will pass an `&Expression` representing it to the provided closure.
//!     2. The provided closure will call `expr.apply(&[1, 3])` and get `Some(5)` as the output (note that due to the operator precedence of `+` and `^`, the expression is equivalent to `a^(b+1)`).
//!     3. Since this matches, the closure will continue to the next condition, calling `expr.apply(&[5, -2])`, and getting `Some(-6)` as the answer.
//!     4. Since this matches too, the closure will continue to the last condition, calling `expr.apply(&[-8, 7])` and getting `Some(-16)` as the answer.
//!     5. Since this doesn't match, the closure will return `false` and the `Searcher` will reject this expression as well.
//! - At some point, the `Searcher` will consider the expression `4^a/(4/b)`.
//!     1. To evaluate this expression, it will pass an `&Expression` representing it to the provided closure.
//!     2. The provided closure will call `expr.apply(&[1, 3])` and get `Some(5)` as the output.
//!     3. Since this matches, the closure will continue to the next condition, calling `expr.apply(&[5, -2])`, and getting `Some(-6)` as the answer.
//!     4. Since this matches too, the closure will continue to the last condition, calling `expr.apply(&[-8, 7])` and getting `None` as the answer because evaluating the expression at the those inputs would cause Rust to divide by zero and crash.
//!     5. Since this is the expected output as well, the closure will return `true` and the `Searcher` will accept this expression, displaying it in the Solutions panel of the UI (if this search included a UI) and returning it in the final `results` Vec.
//!
//! **Golfing tip:** There is room for considerable ingenuity and creativity in specifying the criterion that a `Searcher` will apply. It can be any predicate. Using your imagination will take you further than only copying the format of the documented examples.
//!
//! ## Steps 3 and 4: Additional search parameters and execution
//!
//! For a list of `Searcher`'s methods, including the ones for specifying additional search parameters and executing the search, see [its documentation page][crate::Searcher].
//!
//! **Note:** If you opt to use the `.run_silently()` method, then there will be no way to quit the search before Clubs decides it's done. So, if you plan to use that method, you probably want to specify a combination of search parameters that make the search task finite.
